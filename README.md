Pokemon Stats Search

No target browser, but preferably done on computer as easier to view.

The API I used is https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/[InsertNameOfPokemon]/
You will need to append the name of the Pokemon to [InsertNameOfPokemon] to get its API data.
The API gives information on a Pokemon such as abilities, what games it appeared in, its sprites in different games, and of course the stats.

My visualization would show a bar graph of the 6 Pokemon stats (HP, Attack, Defense Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed) and a 2D sprite of the Pokemon.

No CSS framework was used.

I want users to have quick access to knowing the stats of a Pokemon in order to aid them in beating their opponent. Knowing if you are faster and how your attack/special attack hold up to their defense/special defense are crucial in beating your opponent.

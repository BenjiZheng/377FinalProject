Pokemon Stats Search

No target browser, but preferably done on computer as easier to view.

The API I used is https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/[InsertNameOfPokemon]/

My visualization would show a bar graph of the 6 Pokemon stats (HP, Attack, Defense Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed) and a 2D sprite of the Pokemon

No CSS framework was used

I want users to have quick access to knowing the stats of a Pokemon in order to aid them in beating their opponent.

        This website allows you to search up the stats (HP, Attack, Defense,
        Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed) for a Pokemon. You must type in
        the name of a Pokemon correctly (all in lowercase). Different forms, mega forms,
        and regional varients must be followed with a dash and the form name/"mega"/region
        name (i.e deoxys-attack/lucario-mega/meowth-alola). The new Paradox Pokemons 
        (consisting of two words must also be hyphenated (i.e. great-tusk)) If you type
        in a non-Pokemon you will get an error message. A successful input will result
        in a bar chart of the stats as well as a 2-D sprite of the Pokemon. change
